## APPROACHES FOR HIERARCHICAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
by [Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning: A Comprehensive Survey](https://github.com/SiyiDai/OCRL_Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning_Paper_List/blob/master/Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning:%20A_Comprehensive_Survey.pdf)

* Approaches with subtask discovery or without it. 
* Approaches for training single agent or multiple agents. 
* Approaches for learning on single task or multiple tasks.

1. Single agent, single task, without subtask discovery: The approaches in this division are
grouped into a major class called *Learning Hierarchical Policy* **(LHP)**. The LHP approaches
address the challenge of learning the hierarchical policy π hierarchy of an HRL agent with-
out concerning with subtask discovery. They use handcrafted subtasks.
2. Single agent, single task, with subtask discovery: The approaches in this division are
grouped into two major classes. The first class is called *Learning Hierarchical Policy in
Unification with Subtask Discovery* **(UNI)**. The UNI approaches address the challenge of
learning the subtask space Ω hier ar chy and the hierarchical policy π hier ar chy in a unified
or end-to-end manner. The second class is called *Independent Subtask Discovery* **(ISD)**.
The approaches in this class address the challenge of discovering task-agnostic subtasks
independently from any specific task. The subtask discovery is usually performed in a
pre-training stage and then the subtasks are used to learn HRL agents on downstream
tasks.
3. Multiple agent, single task, without subtask discovery.
4. Multiple agent, single task, with subtask discovery. The approaches in divisions 3 and 4
are grouped into one class called *Multi-Agent HRL* **(MAHRL)**. The MAHRL approaches
broadly address the challenge of learning to coordinate among multiple HRL agents on a
single joint task.
5. Single agent, multiple tasks, without subtask discovery.
6. Single agent, multiple tasks, with subtask discovery. The approaches in divisions 5 and 6
are grouped into one class called *Transfer learning with HRL* **(TransferHRL)**. The Trans-
ferHRL approaches broadly address the challenge of learning to transfer the hierarchical
policy, subtasks, or other knowledge of an HRL agent across multiple tasks, where the
subtasks may be handcrafted or discovered from scratch on multiple tasks.
